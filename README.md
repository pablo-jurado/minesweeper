## Tech/framework used

Built with:
* [React] with [functional, stateless components]
* TODO: add [Immutable-js] and [persistent data structure]
* Vanilla CSS
* ES6 with Babel


## Development Setup

```sh
# In the project directory, you can run:

npm start

# Runs the app in the development mode.
# Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

# The page will reload if you make edits.
# You will also see any lint errors in the console.

npm run build

# Builds the app for production to the build folder.
# It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

# The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
# Your app is ready to be deployed!
```
